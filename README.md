This is my ugly and simple project of a docking program for notes and reminders. Instead of constantly having to minimize or find and maximize notes when needing quick information, this program stays docked just above the taskbar that always stays in the foreground. The files are stored and read from text files that store the note text, title, colors, and note position in the menu. Reminders are found in the other menu and will display a windows notification when the reminder's time and date is reached. These reminders will also be stored in a text file and read in case of a computer restart or crash the reminders will still be available.
This is just a simple project that I have been working on for my notes at work, in my spare time I try to add a little here and there. Still a work in progress but hopefully will be helpful in a few situtations.
